Hey Mr. Seeoh, I’ve finished connecting the wires.
Mr. Seeoh?
For the last time JT, I’m the C-E-O. My name is not Mr. Seeoh.
JT
Oh, right, sorry.
CEO
...
JT
Right... So... I finished connecting those wires?
CEO
I heard you the first time.
JT
And...
CEO
And what?
JT
That was my last task for the internship, right?
CEO
Right.
JT
So, I’m officially done with the internship, right?
CEO
Correct.
JT
...
CEO
...
JT
... So, should I expect a check or...
CEO
A check for what?
JT
For all the work I did for the internship?
CEO
...
CEO
...pft...
CEO
AHAHAHAHAHA!!!
JT
... What’s so funny?
CEO
Oh JT, didn’t you read the details of your contract? You’re an UNPAID intern.
CEO
Everything you gained from this internship was in the form of experience and knowledge!
JT
But... THAT’S NOT FAIR! This was advertised as a PAID internship, and I didn’t learn anything!
CEO
Well maybe next time you should read something before you sign it.
CEO
Regardless your job is done, feel free to take a piece of candy for your dog on your way out.
CEO
JT, you’re done. Leave before I call security.
CEO
JT you madman what are you doing!?
JT
HERE’S WHAT I THINK OF YOUR CANDY!!!
